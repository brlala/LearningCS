# LearningCS
This is a road plan for the transition into CS

#### Bringing up to par before reading all these materials:
-https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/

-Use MEAN stack, Docker, Amazon, TDD


### 1. Getting the fundamentals right is important
-CS50: Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard | edX

### 2. Understand algorithmic complexity
-(source to be added)

### 3. Learning Data Structures
-(source to be added)

### 4. Learning Algorithms
-Introduction to Algorithms by MIT
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2008/
